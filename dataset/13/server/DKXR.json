The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 1\n - Current Turn: 1\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - No quests completed yet\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 2 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 1\n - Current Turn: 2\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - No quests completed yet\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 2 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 1\n - Current Turn: 5\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - No quests completed yet\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 2 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\npropose_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 0\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - No team proposed\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nYour objective is to propose a mission team consisting of 3 players. Consider the following factors when selecting team members:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nPresent your team selection to the other players with a detailed rationale based on past events and player behaviors. Remember that you are on the good side - avoid selecting players who seem suspicious or were part of failed missions. It's conventional to include yourself in the team unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\nPlease propose a mission team composed of 3 members and provide a message to the other players justifying your choices following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 1\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 4\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nvote_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 6\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nVote on the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 0 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\npropose_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 0\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - No team proposed\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Consider the following factors when selecting team members:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nPresent your team selection to the other players with a detailed rationale based on past events and player behaviors. Remember that you are on the good side - avoid selecting players who seem suspicious or were part of failed missions. It's conventional to include yourself in the team unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\nPlease propose a mission team composed of 4 members and provide a message to the other players justifying your choices following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 3\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - Proposed Team: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

              "content": "The following is my request:\n\"\"\"\nYou are playing a social deduction game, The Resistance: Avalon. The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 5\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - Proposed Team: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1. Keep in mind that this is your proposed team and as such you should approve it.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 0 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Paul. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 4\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Sam\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam, Paul\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Paul. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Paul. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 8\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Sam\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 11\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Sam\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe?

Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Sam, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player).

Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 1\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Kira\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 3\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Kira\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out.

Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point.

Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team.

But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out.

I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe?

Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point.

Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team.

But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it.

Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 0 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 0 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\npropose_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 7\n - Failed Party Votes: 1\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Jane\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nYour objective is to propose a mission team consisting of 4 players. Consider the following factors when selecting team members:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nPresent your team selection to the other players with a detailed rationale based on past events and player behaviors. Remember that you are on the good side - avoid selecting players who seem suspicious or were part of failed missions. It's conventional to include yourself in the team unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\nPlease propose a mission team composed of 4 members and provide a message to the other players justifying your choices following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 9\n - Failed Party Votes: 1\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Jane\n - Proposed Team: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n    - Team 8 (proposed by Jane in quest 5): Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well. Jane was also on failed quests. This isn't 100%. Again this is our last chance to get this right... I wish we had more to go off of.\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 10\n - Failed Party Votes: 1\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Jane\n - Proposed Team: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n    - Team 8 (proposed by Jane in quest 5): Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well. Jane was also on failed quests. This isn't 100%. Again this is our last chance to get this right... I wish we had more to go off of.\n - Mia: i'm voting no here – jane's been on both failed quests\n - Mia: lets try me, paul, kira & luca instead\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well.

I wish we had more to go off of.\n - Mia: i'm voting no here – jane's been on both failed quests\n - Mia: lets try me, paul, kira & luca instead\n - Luca: i’m voting no\n - Luca: jane’s been on both failed quests so let’s run me, kira, paul and mia instead\n - Sam: im like 99% sure jane has got to be one of them i dont like this, we failed both times with them? i can't vote this one thru\n - Kira: this could work, yea.. still don't know much about Paul (also Luca is still suspicious), but I agree that it is suspicious that Mia and Sam were on both failed quests..

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 1 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 15\n - Failed Party Votes: 2\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n    - Team 8 (proposed by Jane in quest 5): Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca | Votes: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n    - Team 9 (proposed by Paul in quest 5): Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Sam\n - Paul: Alright I'm just suggesting a pairing at random. And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well. Jane was also on failed quests. This isn't 100%. Again this is our last chance to get this right... I wish we had more to go off of.\n - Mia: i'm voting no here – jane's been on both failed quests\n - Mia: lets try me, paul, kira & luca instead\n - Luca: i’m voting no\n - Luca: jane’s been on both failed quests so let’s run me, kira, paul and mia instead\n - Sam: im like 99% sure jane has got to be one of them i dont like this, we failed both times with them? i can't vote this one thru\n - Kira: this could work, yea.. still don't know much about Paul (also Luca is still suspicious), but I agree that it is suspicious that Mia and Sam were on both failed quests.. Jane was, as well, but we have to put one of the three of them on here, so it's a metter of whichever we think will screw us\n - Kira: I think running with Sam instead of Jane would be fine? Can't say I trust them too much more than Mia, but it feels right for some reason\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and finish strong\n - Voiceover: Jane initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Paul: Um. Okay\n - Paul: We could try the combination a few people suggested last time?\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Luca, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 16\n - Failed Party Votes: 2\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n    - Team 8 (proposed by Jane in quest 5): Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca | Votes: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n    - Team 9 (proposed by Paul in quest 5): Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 19\n - Failed Party Votes: 2\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n    - Team 8 (proposed by Jane in quest 5): Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca | Votes: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n    - Team 9 (proposed by Paul in quest 5): Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well. Jane was also on failed quests. This isn't 100%. Again this is our last chance to get this right... I wish we had more to go off of.\n - Mia: i'm voting no here – jane's been on both failed quests\n - Mia: lets try me, paul, kira & luca instead\n - Luca: i’m voting no\n - Luca: jane’s been on both failed quests so let’s run me, kira, paul and mia instead\n - Sam: im like 99% sure jane has got to be one of them i dont like this, we failed both times with them? i can't vote this one thru\n - Kira: this could work, yea.. still don't know much about Paul (also Luca is still suspicious), but I agree that it is suspicious that Mia and Sam were on both failed quests.. Jane was, as well, but we have to put one of the three of them on here, so it's a metter of whichever we think will screw us\n - Kira: I think running with Sam instead of Jane would be fine? Can't say I trust them too much more than Mia, but it feels right for some reason\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and finish strong\n - Voiceover: Jane initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Paul: Um. Okay\n - Paul: We could try the combination a few people suggested last time?\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n - Mia: this team looks good – no sam or jane (they’ve been on both fails) and paul, luca, kira haven’t tanked anything, so i’m voting yes\n - Luca: i’m good with this team, no sam or jane (they were on both failed quests) and paul/luca/kira haven’t flopped yet so vote yes\n - Sam: i voted yes on the initial two runs i think theres gotta be an enemy amongst one of you guys but i dont know, i cant vote this thru\n - Kira: I'd say sure, we can try it out and see what comes of it\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Jane, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nvote_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 5\n - Current Turn: 20\n - Failed Party Votes: 2\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Success | Quest 3: Fail | Quest 4: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Paul in quest 1): Mia, Sam | Votes: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Sam in quest 4): Mia, Sam, Jane | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n    - Team 6 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 7 (proposed by Kira in quest 5): Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia | Votes: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n    - Team 8 (proposed by Jane in quest 5): Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca | Votes: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n    - Team 9 (proposed by Paul in quest 5): Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

And we can go from there\n - Mia: Sam’s been chill so far and we need to get Quest 1 going\n - Mia: I’m ok w/ me + Sam so vote yes\n - Luca: down to run Mia+Sam for Q1, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down\n - Kira: works for me, to start things off\n - Jane: Mia and Sam seem chill so far, no red flags\n - Jane: I’m good w/ this team so vote yes and let’s get Quest 1 started\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Paul: yes, Sam: yes, Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Mia: lets do me sam and jane for q2 since me+sam aced q1 and jane had no weird vibes when we voted\n - Luca: mia sam & jane seem fine, no red flags so vote yes\n - Sam: down again\n - Kira: seems fine for now, but the evil person could have also abstained from failing the quest the first time (doesn't hurt to try this tho)\n - Jane: sam and mia worked fine on q1, no red flags so far so im good w this team\n - Paul: Just because they passed the first quest. Doesn't mean we should rule them out. But I don't have any better ideas, so we can run this one.\n - Mia: sam and i aced q1 and jane has been chill no weird vibes lets go\n - Voiceover: Mia initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Sam: yes, Kira: yes, Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Jane: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Luca proposed a party: Luca, Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Luca: hey guys lets run me mia sam and jane since they aced the first two with no weird vibes wanna keep the streak\n - Sam: sure\n - Kira: nice nice, we could try it out and see\n - Jane: luca mia sam and me all aced the first 2 quests no weird vibes so im good with yes lets keep the streak\n - Paul: Just because Sam/Mia/Jane worked doesn't mean that the addition of Luca will. I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know.

I am not convinced.\n - Paul: I think we need to explore more people within the group, in order to be that confident\n - Mia: me sam jane and luca all aced the first two quests no weird vibes, pauls hesitation feels random so im voting yes on this team\n - Luca: hey guys lets roll me mia sam and jane they aced both quests so far no weird vibes\n - Voiceover: Luca initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Mia: yes, Kira: no, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Sam: I think Mia and I are safe? Not sure what to go off of here other than hoping us three are all safe and we win the game right here, but im open to ideas, we still have one mistake that we can make\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Paul\n - Kira: I agree that Luca should not be included in this quest, but why not run with Mia, Jane, and Sam again since it succeeded last time? Paul could be evil in this case (but I guess Jane could be too.....)\n - Jane: gonna vote no, paul seems sketchy\n - Jane: lets try Mia Sam Kira instead\n - Paul: I am good with Mia/Sam/Me. I trust Mia and Sam together, they have succeeded the first two times.\n - Paul: I get that I am an unknown quantity in this. But, there isn't really a great way to work around it. We haven't had a group with Kira yet either and one of us needs to be added in at some point. Right?\n - Mia: i’m good with me sam and paul – paul’s been solid and we avoid anyone from that failed quest, so vote yes\n - Luca: think paul is untested and could flop\n - Luca: jane aced both with no weird vibes\n - Luca: let’s run mia, sam, jane\n - Sam: actually im not too sure on paul, maybe would be safe to run someone else but\n - Sam: maybe if this fails we run paul?\n - Voiceover: Sam proposed a party: Mia, Sam, Jane\n - Kira: yea this works for me.. either running me or Paul in the mix if this fails should be fine\n - Jane: im voting no on this, lets test someone new by running mia sam kira\n - Paul: I'm okay with returning to what we know. Just as a have to ensure we know what we know.\n - Mia: i'm good w me sam and jane - clean record + no weird vibes, vote yes\n - Luca: thinking we test someone new – mia and sam have been solid so far\n - Luca: let’s try mia, sam, kira this time to see where votes fall\n - Voiceover: Sam initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Luca: no, Jane: no, Mia: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has failed!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Jane\n - Kira: not much justification for this, but I figured might as well throw myself in there with Paul just to see, and then remove one of the people from the past couple of runs to narrow it down\n - Jane: sam was on both failed quests so i'm voting no on this team, swap him for luca\n - Paul: There is a lot of new people on this team. I'm not too sure about it. But, I also think we aren't getting anywhere sticking with the current set up.\n - Paul: I'm nervous because this is the last round to get it right. But, I don't have any better ideas other than to bring in new people.\n - Mia: no on this, sam’s been on both failed quests\n - Mia: swap sam for me\n - Luca: i’d vote no, sam and jane are on both failed quests\n - Luca: let’s try kira, paul, mia and me instead\n - Sam: wait janes gotta be one of them, we passed each time until we added her? theyre forced to say no to each quest because we've been one away from winning the past two rounds\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Kira, Sam, Paul, Mia\n - Kira: we can vote on this maybe, and then try another team if it's rejected\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Kira: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes, Jane: no, Mia: no, Luca: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Voiceover: Jane proposed a party: Jane, Paul, Kira, Luca\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and get this done\n - Paul: Well. Jane was also on failed quests. This isn't 100%. Again this is our last chance to get this right... I wish we had more to go off of.\n - Mia: i'm voting no here – jane's been on both failed quests\n - Mia: lets try me, paul, kira & luca instead\n - Luca: i’m voting no\n - Luca: jane’s been on both failed quests so let’s run me, kira, paul and mia instead\n - Sam: im like 99% sure jane has got to be one of them i dont like this, we failed both times with them? i can't vote this one thru\n - Kira: this could work, yea.. still don't know much about Paul (also Luca is still suspicious), but I agree that it is suspicious that Mia and Sam were on both failed quests.. Jane was, as well, but we have to put one of the three of them on here, so it's a metter of whichever we think will screw us\n - Kira: I think running with Sam instead of Jane would be fine? Can't say I trust them too much more than Mia, but it feels right for some reason\n - Jane: sam and mia were on both failed quests so skipping them this time running me paul kira luca to test fresh ppl and finish strong\n - Voiceover: Jane initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Paul: yes, Kira: no, Sam: no, Luca: no, Mia: no, Jane: no\n - Voiceover: The party has been rejected!\n - Paul: Um. Okay\n - Paul: We could try the combination a few people suggested last time?\n - Voiceover: Paul proposed a party: Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira\n - Mia: this team looks good – no sam or jane (they’ve been on both fails) and paul, luca, kira haven’t tanked anything, so i’m voting yes\n - Luca: i’m good with this team, no sam or jane (they were on both failed quests) and paul/luca/kira haven’t flopped yet so vote yes\n - Sam: i voted yes on the initial two runs i think theres gotta be an enemy amongst one of you guys but i dont know, i cant vote this thru\n - Kira: I'd say sure, we can try it out and see what comes of it\n - Jane: no on this, mia’s been on both failed quests so let’s run paul, luca, kira and me instead\n - Voiceover: Paul initiated a party vote.\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nVote on the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Paul, Luca, Kira. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 2 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"
