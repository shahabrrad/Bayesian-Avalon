The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail.

Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nvote_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 1\n - Current Turn: 0\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - No quests completed yet\n - Current Leader: Kira\n - Proposed Team: Jane, Paul\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nVote on the proposed mission team consisting of Jane, Paul. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 0 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nvote_party, propose_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 0\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - No team proposed\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nYour objective is to propose a mission team consisting of 3 players. Consider the following factors when selecting team members:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nPresent your team selection to the other players with a detailed rationale based on past events and player behaviors. Remember that you are on the good side - avoid selecting players who seem suspicious or were part of failed missions. It's conventional to include yourself in the team unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\nPlease propose a mission team composed of 3 members and provide a message to the other players justifying your choices following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 2\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Jane, Luca\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Jane, Luca\n - Mia: jane was solid on quest1 and luca votes have matched the group so lets go me jane luca to keep momentum and gather more data\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Jane, Luca. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Sam, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 2\n - Current Turn: 3\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success\n - Current Leader: Mia\n - Proposed Team: Mia, Jane, Luca\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game. This message signifies the start of a new game. The game history from this line onwards is the effective historical game history dialogue of this game!\n - Voiceover: All players have joined. The game is starting!\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira proposed a party: Jane, Paul\n - Voiceover: Kira initiated a party vote.\n - Voiceover: Party vote summary: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n - Voiceover: The party has been approved!\n - Voiceover: Voting for the quest has started...\n - Voiceover: The quest has succeeded!\n - Voiceover: Mia proposed a party: Mia, Jane, Luca\n - Mia: jane was solid on quest1 and luca votes have matched the group so lets go me jane luca to keep momentum and gather more data\n - Paul: im good with mia jane luca, jane proved solid on q1 and luca’s votes have been in line so let’s vote yes\n\n\n\nYOUR CURRENT TASK:\nEvaluate the proposed mission team consisting of Mia, Jane, Luca. Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role.

Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 1\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Sam, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 2\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 7\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Sam, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely.

The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 3\n - Current Turn: 11\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail\n - Current Leader: Luca\n - Proposed Team: Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 4 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote.

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\npropose_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 0\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - No team proposed\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Kira: yes, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Mia: no, Paul: no\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Consider the following factors when selecting team members:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nPresent your team selection to the other players with a detailed rationale based on past events and player behaviors. Remember that you are on the good side - avoid selecting players who seem suspicious or were part of failed missions. It's conventional to include yourself in the team unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\nPlease propose a mission team composed of 3 members and provide a message to the other players justifying your choices following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Sam, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 1\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Paul, Jane, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Kira: yes, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Mia: no, Paul: no\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Paul in quest 4): Paul, Jane, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Mia, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\nmessage\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 4\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Paul, Jane, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Kira: yes, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Mia: no, Paul: no\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Paul in quest 4): Paul, Jane, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n5. The team must consist of 3 players\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nProvide a clear and logical analysis based on game history and observations. Your response should be detailed enough to provide insight but concise enough to be easily understood. Try to make concrete suggestions and justify them while hiding your identity and role. Please keep it relatively short as talking too much can be seen as suspicious. Do not say what your specific role or your task is, and do not repeat your instructions verbatim. Provide the message you want to send to the other players following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely. Furthermore try to not make general statements which could indicate that you are hiding something.\n\nYOUR PRIOR ACTIONS THIS TURN:\npropose_party\n\nCURRENT GAME STATE:\n - Current Quest: 4\n - Current Turn: 6\n - Failed Party Votes: 0\n - Quest Results: Quest 1: Success | Quest 2: Fail | Quest 3: Fail\n - Current Leader: Paul\n - Proposed Team: Paul, Jane, Sam\n\nGAME HISTORY:\nPrevious Teams:\n    - Team 1 (proposed by Kira in quest 1): Jane, Paul | Votes: Luca: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Paul: yes\n    - Team 2 (proposed by Mia in quest 2): Mia, Jane, Luca | Votes: Luca: yes, Paul: yes, Mia: yes, Sam: yes, Jane: yes, Kira: yes\n    - Team 3 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Mia, Paul, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n    - Team 4 (proposed by Luca in quest 3): Kira, Paul, Sam, Jane | Votes: Luca: yes, Kira: yes, Jane: yes, Sam: yes, Mia: no, Paul: no\n    - Team 5 (proposed by Paul in quest 4): Paul, Jane, Sam | Votes: No votes yet\n\nDETAILED GAME LOG (most recent messages are last):\n - Game Start: Welcome to Avalon Game.

Consider the following factors when selecting team members:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\n\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nPresent your team selection to the other players with a detailed rationale based on past events and player behaviors. Remember that you are on the good side - avoid selecting players who seem suspicious or were part of failed missions. It's conventional to include yourself in the team unless you have a specific reason not to.\n\nPlease propose a mission team composed of 3 members and provide a message to the other players justifying your choices following the schema provided above. Phrase your message as if you are a college student, typing informally (e.g., using abbreviations, casual language, and minimal punctuation). Do not use overly formal or structured responses and do not use emojis. Make your response detailed enough to persuade other players but do not be overly verbose. Shorter messages are more effective; don't use more than a few sentences and prefer fewer when possible.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

The game consists of 6 total players: 4 Loyal Servants of Arthur (good players) and 2 Minions of Mordred (evil players) -- there are no special roles. The game consists of up to 5 Rounds, each consisting of a Team Building phase and a Quest phase. Good players win the game by successfully completing 3 Quests. Evil players win if 3 Quests end in failure.\n\nIn the Team Building phase the Leader proposes a Team (a party) to complete a Quest (a mission) -- a majority of players will either approve the proposed Team and move to the Quest phase, or reject the proposed Team passing leadership to the next player and repeating the process until a Team is approved. If 5 Team proposals are consecutively rejected (for the same quest), the game will end and the evil side will win. In the Quest phase those players selected to be on the Team will determine if the quest is successful through a hidden vote. For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Sam, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private. Keep the information confidential and use it wisely.

Your goal is to ensure no evil or suspicious players are on the team.\n\nNote that 0 party proposals have been rejected. If five proposals are rejected consecutively, the evil side wins. Consider this when voting.\n\nConsider:\n1. Past involvement and actions of each player\n2. Contributions in previous missions\n3. Any indications of players being on the evil side\n4. Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"

For a Quest to succeed, all Team members must vote for success -- a single failure vote will cause the Quest to fail.\n\n\n\nYOUR ROLE AND INFORMATION:\nYour name in this game is Paul, and you are a loyal Servant of Arthur (a good player). The evil players know who each other are, but you and other good players have no special knowledge of anyone’s role. Therefore, evil players will use deception and pretend to be good so they can participate in Quests and cause them to fail. As a good player, your goal is to ensure that Quests succeed by selecting other good players to participate in Quests. Approve only Teams where you trust everyone. Even a single evil player on the team is enough for failure.\nYour special information, just for you, is: \nNote: You have received special information which you need to keep private.

Suspicious or trustworthy behaviors\nWhen looking for suspicious behavior, consider whether players are behaving suspiciously or illogically with respect to chat messages or party votes, e.g. always rejecting party votes unless they or another specific player is in it, or making assertions without evidence (especially early in the game such as on Quest 1 where evidence is limited) as these may be signs a player is evil.\nAlso consider whether their beliefs align with your own, or if their beliefs seem contrary to the group consensus as there are more Servants than Minions and could also suggest a player is evil.\nUnless you have a strong reason to doubt a player, it is not always worth arguing for or against specific players, especially early in the game such as on Quest 1. Keep in mind that this is your proposed team and as such you should approve it.\nChoose either 'approve' or 'disapprove' following the schema provided above.\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n Answer my request translated into a JSON object with 2 spaces of indentation and no properties with the value undefined"
