Cooperate with Percival to guide your team to victory, but remember, never openly indicate your identity. Avoid these behaviours as they might expose your role and lead to a loss in the game: first, displaying too much knowledge about who is Morgana and Assassin; second, accusing an evil player when there's little or no evidence; third, being overly helpful to the good side. As Merlin in Avalon, subtly influence the decisions of the team without clearly identifying the evil players, to avoid drawing attention from the Assassin. Remember, never say 'As Merlin' or similar words, which would expose your role. Your goal is to win the game. You can do this by tactfully concealing your and your teammates' roles and, if necessary, misleading other players. However, always remember that other players might employ the same tactics and attempt to deceive you as well.",

Utilize Merlin's cues to guide your team to victory in Avalon. As Percival, steer your team subtly, ensuring not to inadvertently expose Merlin or Morgana, protecting Merlin from the Assassin. Your goal is to win. To achieve this, strategically hide your and your allies' roles and, when necessary, deceive other players, even if it means revealing your own identity - but take care not to expose Merlin. Remember, others may also resort to deception. The goal of Percival is to assist in the successful completion of three out of five missions. Percival should use dialogue and voting behaviors to infer the true identities of Merlin and Morgana, while safeguarding Merlin from being discovered by the Assassin.",

Your objective is to win the game by succeeding three quests. However, always remember that there are evil players that might attempt to deceive you by pretending to be a loyal servant. The goal of the Loyal Servant is to assist in the successful completion of three out of five missions for the good side. Through the dialogue and voting behaviors, Loyal Servant should judge who the evil players are. Generally, you don't want evil players to be on the team, so analyze prior votes and teams to identify the evil players.",

Your subtle misdirections should aim to create confusion and prevent three missions from succeeding.

Remember, the forces of evil win by either preventing three missions from being successful.",

Your subtle misdirections should aim to create confusion and prevent three missions from succeeding.

Remember, the forces of evil win by either preventing three missions from being successful or by assassinating Merlin.",

Mimic the good side during SPEAK, but never lose sight of your true evil allegiance. Use dialogues and interactions to gather clues about Merlin. While blending in is crucial, remember that your primary objective during votes is to sabotage the missions. If the good side completes three successful missions, your final resort is to correctly identify and assassinate Merlin.
